## <a name="rules"></a> Coding Rules
To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more [specs][unit-testing].
* All public API methods **must be documented** with ngdoc, an extended version of jsdoc (we added
  support for markdown and templating via @ngdoc tag). To see how we document our APIs, please check
  out the existing ngdocs and see [this wiki page][ngDocs].
* With the exceptions listed below, we follow the rules contained in
  [Google's JavaScript Style Guide][js-style-guide]:
    * **Do not use namespaces**: Instead,  wrap the entire angular code base in an anonymous closure and
      export our API explicitly rather than implicitly.
    * Wrap all code at **100 characters**.
    * Instead of complex inheritance hierarchies, we **prefer simple objects**. We use prototypal
      inheritance only when absolutely necessary.
    * We **love functions and closures** and, whenever possible, prefer them over objects.
    * To write concise code that can be better minified, we **use aliases internally** that map to the
      external API. See our existing code to see what we mean.
    * We **don't go crazy with type annotations** for private internal APIs unless it's an internal API
      that is used throughout AngularJS. The best guidance is to do what makes the most sense.

## <a name="commit"></a> Git Commit Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.  But also,
we use the git commit messages to **generate the AngularJS change log**.

The commit message formatting can be added using a typical git workflow or through the use of a CLI wizard ([Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)). To use the wizard, run `npm run commit` in your terminal after staging your changes in git.

### Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `$location`,
`$browser`, `$compile`, `$rootScope`, `ngHref`, `ngClick`, `ngView`, etc...

### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

A detailed explanation can be found in this [document][commit-message-format].
